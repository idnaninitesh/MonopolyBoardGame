==Rules==


===Official rules===
* Players take turns in order, with the initial player determined by chance before the game. 
* A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing their piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares.
* If a player rolls doubles, they roll again after completing their turn.
* If a player rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn, the player has been "caught speeding", and the player is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll, ending the player's turn.

* A player who lands on or passes the Go space collects $200 from the bank.
* However, when the optional Speed Die is used, a player who rolls a triple and chooses to move to "Go to Jail" does not collect if the move would normally take them past Go.

* Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the indicated amount to the bank.
* No reward or penalty is given for landing on Free Parking.

====Chance/Community Chest====

* If a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw the top card from the respective deck and follow its instructions.
* This may include collecting or paying money to the bank or another player, or moving to a different space on the board.
* Two types of cards that involve jail, "Go to Jail" and "[[Get Out of Jail Free card|Get Out of Jail Free]]", are explained below.

====Jail====

* A player is sent to jail for doing any of the following:

* Landing directly on "Go to Jail"
* Drawing the "Go to Jail" card from either the Community Chest or Chance deck

* When a player is sent to jail, they move directly to the Jail space and their turn ends ("[[Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.]]").
* If a player lands on that corner of the board during the course of a turn, they are "Just Visiting" and can move ahead on their next turn without incurring any penalty.

* If a player is in jail, they do not take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest [[Get Out of Jail Free card]]. 
* Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank, due to being unable to move, but can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions.

====Properties====

* If the player lands on an unowned property, whether street, railroad, or utility, they can buy the property for its listed purchase price.
* If they decline this purchase, the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder, including the player who declined to buy.
* If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged, they must pay the owner a given rent, the price dependent on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development.

* When a player owns all of the properties in a color group and none of them are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns.
* Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces, and must be done uniformly across the group.
* That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house.
* Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it.
* Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent also increases if a player owns more than one of either type.

====Mortgaging====

* Properties can also be mortgaged, although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded.
* The player receives money from the bank for each mortgaged property (half of the purchase price), which must be repaid with 10% interest to unmortgage.
* Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price.
* Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed.
* The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately unmortgage it for the mortgage price plus 10%, or pay the bank just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must still pay the 10% again if the property is later unmortgaged.

====Bankruptcy====

* A player who cannot pay what they owe is bankrupt and eliminated from the game.
* If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all of their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings.
* If the debt is instead to another player, all the assets are instead given to that opponent, but the new owner must still pay the bank to un-mortgage any such properties received.
* The winner is the remaining player left after all the others have gone bankrupt.

* If a player runs out of money but still has assets that can be converted to cash, they can do so by selling buildings, mortgaging properties, or trading with other players.
* To avoid bankruptcy the player must be able to raise enough cash in order to pay the full amount owed.
